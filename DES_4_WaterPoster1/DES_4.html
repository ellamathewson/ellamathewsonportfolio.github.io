            <p>Social Awareness Poster: Footprints</p>
            <p>This poster is one of three about the lack of access to clean water. The point of this project was to create
                polarized explorations of an enviornmental or social issue and call people to donate or learn more about
                said issue.
            </p>
            <p>This poster features footprints that were made to look like water droplets. The 'button' calls on the viewer
                to help donate, and the call to action says how their donation will help.
