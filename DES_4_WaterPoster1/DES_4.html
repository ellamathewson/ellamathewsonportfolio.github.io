    <p>This poster is one of three about the lack of access to clean water. The point of this project
        was to create polarized explorations of an enviornmental or social issue and call people to 
        donate or learn more about said issue. 
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>This poster features footprints that were made to look like water droplets. The 'button' calls
        on the viewer to help donate, and the call to action says how their donation will help.
