    <p class="aboutPara">Hello! I'm a first year student studying at Rochester Institute 
        of Technology, where I'm majoring in New Media Interactive 
        Development. I'm able to code in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
        Along with this, I am well versed in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and 
        InDesign.</p>
        <br>
     <p class="aboutPara">During my time at RIT, I have taken classes such as
         Digital Survey 1 and 2, as well as Interactive
         Design and Algebra Problem Solving 1 and 2, which have taught me in-depth 
         about design and programming.  
         I have also worked on personal projects, which include an interactive
         game for a Hackathon on campus, which my team and I are currently updating, 
         <a href="https://ellamathewson.github.io/portfolio/DES_1_Alumni/DES_1.html" 
         class="inText">Alumni posters</a>
         designed for Women in Computing club at RIT, and this portfolio website.</p>  
    <p class="aboutPara">I love overcoming challenges and finding solutions to problems, which is why
        I am always working on new coding projects that will hopefully soon be posted to this site. 
        Along with this, I'm working on some personal design projects and pieces that I also hope to share.
