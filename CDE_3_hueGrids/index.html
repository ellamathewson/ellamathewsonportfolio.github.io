            <p>This interactive program displays a layout of hue grids that are changed by using genetic algorithms. To enact any of the features, hover over a grid and press the plus key if you like it, or the minus key if you do not. Then the genetic algorithms, as described below, can function properly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The crossover button takes 2 random grids and crosses them over together, displaying the child in the first grid location. Mutate changes the first grid randomly. Select takes two random grids, compares their fitness values (how much you like or dislike the grid, based upon how many times the plus or minus key are pressed), and returns the grid with the higher value. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Breed1 selects two parents, does a crossover between them to create a child grid, and then mutates the grid, returning the grid to the first position. Breed Generation goes through all the grids to find the grid with the highest fitness value, and resets that one in the first position, as well as breeds a new generation of grids with similar attributes to the ones with higher fitness values. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Options that are manually changed are max deviation (how fast the boxes flash), brightness, and reset, which resets the grid of hueGrids.</p>
