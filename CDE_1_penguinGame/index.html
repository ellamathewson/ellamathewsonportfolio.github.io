            <p>This mini-game was my first project and was created to test collision in JavaScript. The point of the game is to more around the animal with 'w', 's', 'a', and 'd' to collect the food items. It was recently updated to include buttons and selection methods from the DOM library. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Things I want to improve on with this project is to include more levels, and a function that retains the high score across the various levels. Along with this, I want to display a countdown timer so the player knows how much time is left. I hope to implement these ideas by the end of the summer of 2018.
