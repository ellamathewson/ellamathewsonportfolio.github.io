                <p>Social Awareness Poster: Water Cups</p>
                <p>This poster is the second poster about the lack of access to clean water. The point of this project was
                    to create polarized explorations of an enviornmental or social issue and call people to donate or learn
                    more about said issue.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This poster shows 9 cups, all filled with water, with one of them locked. The anamoly calls attention
                    to the glass as well as displays the statistic in an adequate manner. The call to action also plays along
                    with the theme of the access to water being locked.
