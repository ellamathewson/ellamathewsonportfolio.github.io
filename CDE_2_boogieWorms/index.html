                <p>Boogie Worms</p>
                <p>I worked on this game as my summer project of 2018. It consists of a combination of old code 
                    I learned in my first year at school, and new code that I learned how to use with help from 
                    refrences online. The game itself is focused on using the cursor to catch the "boogie worms" 
                    on the screen. Every five rounds, something changes to increase the difficulty, such as size, 
                    speed, location, etc.
                </p>

                <p>There are some glitches in the game that I hope to keep working on as the summer ends and 
                    throughout the school year. I also hope to add new levels, as well as make the "worms," 
                    which are currently moving lines, into animated sprites.
                </p>
