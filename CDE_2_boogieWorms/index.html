            <p>I worked on this game as my summer project of 2018. It consists of a combination of 
                old code I learned in my first year at school, and new code that I learned how to use
                with help from refrences online. The game itself is focused on using the cursor to catch
                the "boogie worms" on the screen. Every five rounds, something changes to increase the 
                difficulty, such as size, speed, location, etc. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>There are some glitches in the game that I hope to keep working on as the summer ends and
                throughout the school year. I also hope to add new levels, as well as make the "worms," which 
                are currently moving lines, into animated sprites. 
            </p>
