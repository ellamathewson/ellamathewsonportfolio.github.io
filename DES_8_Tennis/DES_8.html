                <p>Tennis Club Poster</p>
                <p>This fall semester in 2018 I got elected as vice president of the RIT Tennis club. In order to advertise
                    for the club, I created these posters to grab people's attention. Unfortunately we had to do most of
                    them in black and white, as printing in color can be expensive.
                </p>

                <p>This poster features a woman preparing to serve a tennis ball. Since her stance is dynamic and almost
                    in motion, the text 'RIT Tennis Club' is curved to add to the motion. The rest of the text on the screen
                    is information about the club, and how to get in contact.
                </p>
