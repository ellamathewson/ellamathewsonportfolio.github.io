<div class="projInfo">
    <p>This fall semester in 2018 I got elected as vice president of the RIT Tennis club. In order to 
        advertise for the club, I created these posters to grab people's attention. Unfortunately we
        had to do most of them in black and white, as printing in color can be expensive. 
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>This poster features a woman preparing to serve a tennis ball. Since her stance is dynamic and almost
        in motion, the text 'RIT Tennis Club' is curved to add to the motion. The rest of the text on the 
        screen is information about the club, and how to get in contact.
