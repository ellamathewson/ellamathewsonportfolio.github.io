            <p>This fall semester in 2018 I got elected as vice president of the RIT Tennis club. In order to advertise for
                the club, I created these posters to grab people's attention. Unfortunately we had to do most of them in
                black and white, as printing in color can be expensive.
            </p>
            
            <p>This poster features a woman preparing to serve a tennis ball. Since her stance is dynamic and almost in motion,
                the text 'RIT Tennis Club' is curved to add to the motion. The rest of the text on the screen is information
                about the club, and how to get in contact.
            </p>
