                <p>Social Awareness Poster: Foutain</p>
                <p>This poster is the third one about the lack of access to clean water. The point of this project was to
                    create polarized explorations of an enviornmental or social issue and call people to donate or learn
                    more about said issue.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This poster shows a water foutain that would be found in school hallways. In place of water coming out of the 
                    faucet, the statistic is flowing out of it instead. The design and graphic was chosen to reflect the 
                    fact in a hope to raise awareness about the lack of access to water.
