    <p>This poster is the third one about the lack of access to clean water. The point of this project
        was to create polarized explorations of an enviornmental or social issue and call people to 
        donate or learn more about said issue. 
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>This poster shows 9 cups, all filled with water, with one of them locked. The anamoly calls attention
        to the glass as well as displays the statistic in an adequate manner. The call to action also plays
        along with the theme of the access to water being locked.
