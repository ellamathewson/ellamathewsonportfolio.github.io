            <p>Hello! I'm a second year student at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in New Media Interactive 
                Development. Using both code and design, I create interactive and immersive experiences. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I am working with a team to create an app called GenderFree Restroom Locating Service. On RIT's campus,
                the gender neutral bathrooms are not clearly marked or easy to find. Along with this, RIT's map does not accurately
                show where they are located. We are working on creating an app to accurately find the family restrooms and gender neutral
                bathrooms on campus using Unity UI and IndoorAtlas. Along with this, we hope to implement AR into our app as well.
                Our deadline goal for the completed project is the end of April 2019, as we are going to display our final product at
                Imagine RIT this year.
            </p>
            <p>Personally, the projects I am working on mostly involve this website. I hope to keep changing the design and integrating  
                    new features into the site as I learn more about web development and user experience. One challenge I faced in creating 
                    this website was with the fading effect from the main screen to the projects page. The jQuery I wrote in order to accomplish 
                    it was outside of what I had learned, so a lot of my time was spent searching the web for solutions to errors I encountered. 
                    There are still a few glitches here and there, but overall I'm happy with my result.
