    <p>This poster was designed for RIT's Women in Computing. Working with a few other 
        members on the Public Relations committee, we designed a series of informational
        posters about RIT Alumni who were also in the club.  
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>It includes information about who they are, what they've been up to since graduating,
        and where they currently are working. The reason behind the posters design was to 
        promote the club as well as show women in technology different paths previous
        graduates have taken. You can find more <a target="blank"
